# Workout Tracker

## Description

This repository was created so I could create the back-end of a workout tracker application via creating a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handling the routes with Express.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript and the following Node.js package: the built in "path" package, and installed via npm packages called "express", "mongoose", and "morgan" to write my applicatian's code.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://frozen-plains-71922.herokuapp.com/ .



### Installation

If you wish to fork this code for your own use, then make sure you have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and MongoDB Community Server (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community?tck=docs_server) installed. And after you've cloned or downloaded your forked repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary "express", "mongoose", and "morgan" packages (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). You'll also need to utilize the command "npm run seed" to set up the neccesary database and collection. After that, if you have everything installed, you simply have to have your terminal in the same direcetory as server.js and use the command "node server.js" to run it. Once it runs you will need to type "localhost:3000" in the address bar of your browser to access the application.



### Usage

To use this workout tracker application click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md. Once the website loads use the "Continue Workout" button to continue the existing workout or the "New Workout" button to start a new workout. After clicking one of those buttons, you will be taken to the exercise page where you can add a new exercise. If this is the only exercis you want to add at the moment, click the "Complete" button after you've filled out the form. This will take you back to the main page. If you would like to add an additional exercise right after this one, click the "Add Exercise" button after you've filled out the form. This will clear the form so you can fill it out with the new exercise information; click the "Complete" button after you fill out the form with the last exercis you wish to add. You can also click the "Dasboard" button in the navigation bar to see the overall stats.



### Credits

I used Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/), the "mongoose" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose), the "express" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express), and the "morgan" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan).

The front-end code was provided by Trilogy Education Services (https://www.trilogyed.com/).

Some of the styling was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).
